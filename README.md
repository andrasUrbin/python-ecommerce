# About python-ecommerce-website

Python Ecommerce Webshop with Django

This repository contains the virtual environment as well as the source code, but it's only for my own comfort and it'll be removed once the product gets to release!

# Before anything:

Run this script to create the neccessary virtual environment: 

virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute .env &&\
    source .env/bin/activate &&\
    pip install -r requirements.txt
